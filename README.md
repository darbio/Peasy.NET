A middle tier framework for .NET
```

#What's a middle tier framework?

A middle tier framework is code that facilitates creating business logic in a reusable, extensible, maintainable, and testable manner.   It promotes creating business logic that is completely decoupled from its consuming technologies and helps to ensure that separation of concerns ([SoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)) are adhered to.

#Where can I get it?

First, install NuGet. Then, install Peasy from the package manager console:

``` PM> Install-Package Peasy ```

You can also download and add the Peasy and/or Peasy.Core projects to your solution

#Getting started

You can get started by reviewing the [getting started example](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki#the-simplest-possible-example) on the Peasy wiki.  The wiki also covers in-depth how-to's, general framework design, and usage scenarios.

You can also check out the [samples repo](https://github.com/peasy/Samples) that contains a sample implementation of a middle tier built with peasy, as well as a sample consumer clients (WPF, Web API, ASP.NET MVC).  You can clone the repo or download the entire project as a [zip](https://github.com/peasy/samples/archive/master.zip).  

Once downloaded, open Orders.com.sln with Visual Studio, set the WPF or ASP.NET MVC project as the startup project and run.  More information about the samples application can be found [here](https://github.com/peasy/Samples).
